**Pancake Maker App** is an application that allows users to customize their pancakes, and manage pancake orders 

 

**Working features:**

Users can choose different pancake **types, toppings, and extras**. The total price updates instantly when users select or deselect something. 

The order summary will be displayed as a draft when users click **See order** button. This is just an overview of the order, and nothing is confirmed yet.
Only when customers click **Confirm order**, will the order be created and sent to the kitchen. The homepage is then automatically reset.  

All current orders can be tracked on an **All order** page, which is accessed from **See all orders** buttons.

Customers can find their orders in the search bar, and check if the orders are waiting, ready or delivered 

Chefs in the kitchen and staff can also find orders from customer name, id, ingredients, delivery method, and filter orders according to their status. 

When order status is changed to delivered, a “Remove order” button will be activated, and the order can be removed thereafter. 

“All orders” page is reloaded every time order status changes to ensure that the order is updated instantly.

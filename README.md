## Pancake Maker is an application that allows users to customize their pancakes, and manage pancake orders 

**Working features:**

- Users can choose different pancake **types, toppings, and extras**.
The total price updates instantly when users select or deselect something. 

- The order summary will be displayed as a draft when users click **See order** button.
This is just an overview of the order, and nothing is confirmed yet.
Only when customers click **Confirm order**, will the order be created and sent to the kitchen. The homepage is then automatically reset.  

- All current orders can be tracked on an **All Order** page, which is accessed from **See all orders** buttons.

- Customers can find their orders in the search bar, and check if the orders are waiting, ready or delivered 

- Chefs in the kitchen and staff can also find orders from customer name, id, ingredients, delivery method, and filter orders according to their status. 

- When order status is changed to delivered, a **Remove order** button will be activated, and the order can be removed thereafter. 

- **All Orders** page is reloaded every time order status changes to ensure that the order is updated instantly.
